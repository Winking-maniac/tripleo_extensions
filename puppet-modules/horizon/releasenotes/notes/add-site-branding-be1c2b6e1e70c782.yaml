    Added new parameter horizon::site_branding which can be used to set the
    SITE_BRANDING settings that controls the title of the web pages that
    horizon will render. The default value is undef which will not add this
    value to the configuration file and the horizon default value of
    'OpenStack Dashboard' will be used.
