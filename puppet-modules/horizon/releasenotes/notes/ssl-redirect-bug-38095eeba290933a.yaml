fixes:
  - |
    Fixed a bug where having ssl and redirection enabled combined with a empty
    root_url did not redirect. If you are setting listen_ssl and ssl_redirect to
    true it will always redirect to https no matter what your root_url is.
  - |
    Fixed a bug where the http vhost would not redirect to the custom root_url when
    setting listen_ssl to true and ssl_redirect to false.
