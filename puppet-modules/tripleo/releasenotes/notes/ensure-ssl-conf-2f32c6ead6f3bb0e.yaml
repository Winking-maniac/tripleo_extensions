    With having package mod_ssl by default installed in images we introduced
    issue with mod_ssl package update. In case of SSL not being used or
    provided by HAproxy the puppet-apache module by default purges the
    ssl.conf file. The package update then recreates the file with default
    Listen 443 option. This causes conflict on 443 port during httpd restart.
    If we include ::apache::mod::ssl the ssl.conf file will be configured and
    the Listen option will be used only if there is vhost set to use SSL.
