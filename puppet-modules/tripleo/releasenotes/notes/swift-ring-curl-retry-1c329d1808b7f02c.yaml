    Retry Swift ring up-/downloads on failures to improve overall
    stability during deployments when there are temporary errors.
    Retries are executed in case of HTTP errors (for example due to a
    temporary issue between the proxy and backend servers) as well as
    connection issue to the proxy itself.
