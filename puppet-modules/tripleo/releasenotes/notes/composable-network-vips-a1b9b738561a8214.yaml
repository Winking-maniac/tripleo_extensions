deprecations:
  - The hardcoded parameter names for network vips in hiera have been
    deprecated and replaced with the network_virtual_ips dict that includes
    composable networks.  Likewise the hardcoded network parameters to
    class tripleo::keepalived have been deprecated.
fixes:
  - The new network_virtual_ips hiera parameter is used to generate all
    network VIP resources in haproxy, haproxy_bundle, and keepalived
    manifests.  Since additional custom networks may be added, the
    virtual_router_ids in keepalived have been reordered.
