     Two custom per-service hiera keys are added
     tripleo::haproxy::<service>::internal_bind_options and
     tripleo::haproxy::<service>::public_bind_options. They control additional
     custom options that can be added to the bind line of a specific service configuration
     in haproxy. One use case is to force older TLS versions for internal APIs that
     end up pointing to devices that do not support the latest TLS standard.
     They accept a single string or an array of strings.
