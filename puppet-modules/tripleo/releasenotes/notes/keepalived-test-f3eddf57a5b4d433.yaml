    Added unit test for tripleo::keepalived class.

    Added network_vips parameter to the tripleo::keepalived class where
    previously it was only exposed via the network_virtual_ips hiera data key.
    The new parameter still uses the network_virtual_ips hiera data for the
    default value or falls back to an empty hash.
