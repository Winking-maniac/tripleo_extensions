    Adds support for puppet standard separator notation in order to be
    able to have unit tests. The "." separator notation doesn't work in
    puppet-rspec, probably because "hiera" isn't called per se. This new
    feature allows to get two hashes, they are merged in the definition.
fixes:
  - Partly fixes `bug 1737086
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/tripleo/+bug/1737086>`__ for unit tests on
    haproxy service_endpoints
