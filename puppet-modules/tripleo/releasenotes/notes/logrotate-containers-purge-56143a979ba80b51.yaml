    Rotated logs of containerized services in /var/log/containers
    will be purged with the next containerized logrotate run
    triggered via cron, if the rotated logs have been kept longer
    than `purge_after_days` (defaults to a 14 days).

    The logrotate maxage parameter is set to `purge_after_days`
    as well.

    The size parameter does not honor time-based
    constraints and is disabled as not GDPR compliant. From now on,
    it configures maxsize instead. Minsize is set to a 1 byte to
    put all /var/log/containers logs under the containerized
    logrotate control.

    New param `rotation` additionally allows to alter logrotate
    rotation interval, like 'hourly' or 'weekly'.
security:
  - |
    Retention rules of files in /var/log/containers additionally
    defined in the containerized logrotate postrotate script and
    based on any of the listed criteria met:

    * time of last access of contents (atime) exceeds
      `purge_after_days`,
    * time of last modification of contents (mtime) exceeds
      `purge_after_days`,
    * time of last modification of the inode (metadata, ctime)
      exceeds `purge_after_days`.

    Expired files will be purged forcibly with each containerized
    logrotate run triggered via cron. Note that the files creation
    time (the Birth attribute) is not taken into account as it
    cannot be accessed normally by system operators (depends on FS
    type). Retention policies based on the creation time must
    be managed elsewhere.
