features:
  - |
    Neutron L3/DHCP and OVN metadata agent wrapper classes are given the
    ``debug`` and ``container_cli`` parameters. The latter allows 'docker'
    (deprecated) and 'podman' for Neutron L3/dhcp and OVN metadata rootwrap
    containers managed by agents.  When ``debug`` enabled, the wrapper
    containers start writing extended outputs to its stdout, which also may be
    shown via the ``podman logs`` CLI.
fixes:
  - |
    Neutron/OVN rootwrap containers are managed by agents and will no longer
    be deleted, when the parent container restarts.
deprecations:
  - |
    Parameter ``bind_sockets`` is deprecated. No sockets are expected to bind
    mount for podman. So it only works for the docker runtime.
