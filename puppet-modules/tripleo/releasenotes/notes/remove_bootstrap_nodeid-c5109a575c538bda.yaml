    All manifests no longer use the bootstrap_nodeid hiera key, since this
    was generated per role and can result in multiple bootstrap nodes when
    a service on more than one role. The SERVICE_short_bootstrap_node_name
    key is used instead, which is automatically generated in tripleo-heat-templates
    based on the service_name key of the service template role_data.
