    Added parameters to generate wrapper scripts for the neutron dhcp and l3 agents
    to run dnsmasq and keepalived, respectively, in separate containers.
  - Added `tripleo::profile::base::docker::additional_sockets` to allow configuring
    additional domain sockets bindings on dockerd. This facilitates creating
    containers that need to access dockerd without having to mount /run.
