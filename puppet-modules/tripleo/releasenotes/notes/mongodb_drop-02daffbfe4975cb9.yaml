    MongoDB hasn't been supported since Pike, it's time to remove the
    deployment files. Starting in Stein, it's not possible to deploy MongoDB
    anymore. It already changes the default zaqar management_store to
    sqlalchemy and the zaqar messaging_store to redis, which is already
    set by TripleO Heat Templates.
